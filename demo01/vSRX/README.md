This template launches a vSRX instance from the vSRX image available at the Azure Marketplace. It also launches other resources necessary to launch a vSRX (such as VNet, Route tables, etc). Please keep in mind that the sole purpose of this template is to demonstrate how a custom template can be built to launch vSRX instances. The topology/dependency presented in this template is for the sole purpose of providing an example and may be different than the users' actual deployment environment.
